Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up an ambitious scheme called Watergrid to end the drought in Marathwada permanently. Aurangabad and Jalna were the only two districts in this scheme in the first phase. But Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar pointed out in the cabinet meeting that Latur and Osmanabad districts are the most affected by drought in Marathwada, so Latur and Osmanabad must be included in the first phase. Consistently pursued it. From this, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis approved the water grid proposal of the Latur and Osmanabad districts in the cabinet meeting held in the first week of September. A fund of Rs 1,713 crore for the Latur district and Rs 1,409 crore for Osmanabad has also been approved for this scheme. This scheme will transform both districts, and all the credit goes to Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar.",
